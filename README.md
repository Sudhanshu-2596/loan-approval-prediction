# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This **Loan Approval Prediction** project is a machine learning model designed to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various financial and demographic factors. The project uses **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleans and processes raw data for accurate predictions.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Provides insights into key factors affecting loan approval.  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Implements various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).  
✅ **Model Evaluation** – Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
✅ **User Input Testing** – Allows users to test loan applications on trained models.
